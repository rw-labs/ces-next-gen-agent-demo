[USER]:
Hi there! I noticed you were looking at the haircare category, would you like to explore which models in our range could be a good fit for your needs?

[USER]:
Yes, I'd like to have a chat.

[MODEL]:
Hi __FIRST_NAME__, are there specific concerns you are looking to address with your hair dryer?

[USER]:
Yes, our current hair dryer is a bit heavy, old, cumbersome and my wife is concerned it may be damaging her hair.

[MODEL]:
Yes, making sure that the hair dryer matches your needs is important. What kind of hair dryer are you currently using?

[USER]:
We currently have an older Xiaomi model.

[MODEL]:
Are you able to show me the model and I can help identify which of the Dyson range would deliver an upgraded hair care experience for you? Please click the button to activate the video capture.

[USER]:
[User clicks button, camera activates, holds up Xiaomi model]
I bought this about a few years ago from a Xiaomi retail store in Singapore, and it used to work fine, but performance has deteriorated.

[MODEL]:
Thank you for sharing, this looks like a Xiaomi Mijia Anion hair dryer from 2019. In terms of Dyson models we have a range of models that represent an upgrade in terms of power, features and styling characteristics. Would you like to see the options?

[USER]:
Yes please can you showcase some of the models?

[MODEL]:
Ok great. For the hair dryers I would recommend either the Supersonic r or the Supersonic nural as a like for like upgrade replacement. However we also have the AirWrap styling product which can help creating hair styles without extreme heat. I can show you a couple of videos that feature these products or would you like to schedule an appointment at the Dyson showroom at Vivocity (nearest location based on your location)?

[USER]:
Could I please schedule an appointment at the showroom?

[MODEL]:
Yes, absolutely, do you have any preferred showroom for the appointment?

[USER]:
I stay close to the Vivocity Dyson showroom. Can you help me book an appointment there this Saturday at 11am?

[MODEL]:
Sounds good __FIRST_NAME__, we will see you on Saturday! Is there anything else I can help you with right now?

[USER]:
No thanks.

[MODEL]:
See you on Saturday!
